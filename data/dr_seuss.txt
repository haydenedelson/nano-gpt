And to Think that I Saw It on Mulberry Street

When I leave home to walk to school,
Dad always says to me, 
"Marco, keep your eyelids up 
And see what you can see." 

But when I tell him where I've been 
And what I think I've seen, 
He looks at me and sternly says, 
"Your eyesight's much too keen. 

‘Stop telling such outlandish tales. 
Stop turning minnows into whales."

Now, what can I say 
When I get home today?

All the long way to school
And all the way back,
I've looked and I've looked
And I've kept careful track,
But all that I've noticed,
Except my own feet,
Was a horse and a wagon
On Mulberry Street.

"That's nothing to tell of,
That won't do, of course...
Just a broken-down wagon
That's drawn by a horse.

That can't be my story. That's only a start.
I'll say that a ZEBRA was pulling that cart!
And that is a story that no one can beat,
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street.

Yes, the zebra is fine,
But I think it's a shame,
Such a marvelous beast
With a cart that's so tame.
The story would really be better to hear
If the driver I saw were a charioteer.
A gold and blue chariot's something to meet, 
Rumbling like thunder down Mulberry Street

No, it won't do at all...
A zebra's too small.

A reindeer is better;
He's fast and he's fleet,

And he'd look mighty smart
On old Mulberry Street.

Hold on a minute!
There's something wrong!

A reindeer hates the way it feels 
To pull a thing that runs on wheels.

He'd be much happier, instead,
If he could pull a fancy sled.

Hmmmm... A reindeer and sleigh...

Say—anyone could think of that,
Jack or Fred ог Joe or Nat—
Say, even Jane could think of that.

But it isn't too late to make one little change 
A sleigh and an ELEPHANT! There's something strange!

I'll pick one with plenty of power and size,
A blue one with plenty of fun in his eyes.
And then, just to give him a little more tone,
Have a Rajah, with rubies, perched high on a throne.

Say! That makes a story that no one can beat,
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street.

But now I don't know...
It still doesn't seem right.

An elephant pulling a thing that's so light
Would whip it around in the air like a kite.

But he'd look simply grand
With a great big brass band!

A band that's so good should have someone to hear it
But it's going so fast that it's hard to keep near it. 
I'll put on a trailer! I know they won't mind 
If a man sits and listens while hitched on behind.

But now is it fair? Is it fair what I've done?
I'll bet those wagons weigh more than a ton.
That's really too heavy a load for one beast;
I'll give him some helpers. He needs two, at least.

But now what worries me is this...
Mulberry Street runs into Bliss.

Unless there's something I can fix up,
There'll be an awful traffic mix-up!

It takes Police to do the trick,
То guide them through where traffic's thick — 
It takes Police to do the trick.

They'll never crash now. They'll race at top speed
With Sergeant Mulvaney, himself, in the lead.

The Mayor is there
And he thinks it is grand,
And he raises his hat
As they dash by the stand.

The Mayor is there
And the Aldermen too,
All waving big banners
Of red, white and blue.

And that is a story that NO ONE can beat
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street!

With a roar of its motor an airplane appears
And dumps out confetti while everyone cheers

And that makes a story that's really not bad!
But it still could be better. Suppose that I add...

.. A Chinaman
Who eats with sticks....

A big Magician
Doing tricks...

A ten-foot beard
That needs a comb....

No time for more.
I'm almost home.

I swung 'round the corner
And dashed through the gate,
I ran up the steps
And I felt simply GREAT!

FOR I HAD A STORY THAT NO ONE COULD BEAT!
AND TO THINK THAT I SAW IT ON MULBERRY STREET!

But Dad said quite calmly,
"Just draw up your stool
And tell me the sights
On the way home from school."

There was so much to tell, I JUST COULDN'T BEGIN!
Dad looked at me sharply and pulled at his chin.
He frowned at me sternly from there in his seat,
"Was there nothing to look at... no people to greet?
Did nothing excite you or make your heart beat?"

"Nothing," I said, growing red as a beet,
"But a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street."

How a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street
Grows into a story that no опе can beat...



Horton Hatches the Egg

Sighed Mayzie, a lazy bird hatching an egg:
"I'm tired and I'm bored
And I've kinks in my leg
From sitting, just sitting here day after day.
It's work! How I hate it!
I'd much rather play!
I'd take a vacation, fly off for a rest
If I could find someone to stay on my nest!
If I could find someone, I'd fly away – free..."

Then Horton, the Elephant, passed by her tree.
"Hello!" called the lazy bird, smiling her best.
"You've nothing to do and I do need a rest.
Would YOU like to sit on the egg in my nest?"

The elephant laughed.

"Why, of all silly things!
I haven't feathers and I haven't wings.
ME on your egg? Why, that doesn't make sense...
Your egg is so small, ma'am, and I'm so immense!"

"Tut, tut," answered Mayzie. "I know you're not small 
But I'm sure you can do it. No trouble at all.
Just sit on it softly. You're gentle and kind.
Come, be a good fellow. I know you won't mind."

"I can't," said the elephant.
"PL-E-E-ASE!" begged the bird.
"I won't be gone long, sir. I give you my word.
I'll hurry right back. Why, I'll never be missed..."

"Very well," said the elephant, "since you insist...
You want a vacation. Go fly off and take it.
I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to break it.
I'll stay and be faithful. I mean what I say."
"Toodle-oo!" sang out Mayzie and fluttered away.

"H-m-m-m... the first thing to do," murmured Horton,
"Let's see...
The first thing to do is to prop up this tree
And make it much stronger. That has to be done
Before I get on it. I must weight a ton."
Then carefully, tenderly, gently he crept
Up the trunk to the nest where the little egg slept.

The Horton the elephant smiled, "Now that's that..."
And he sat
And he sat
And he sat
And he sat...

And he sat all that day, 
and he kept the egg warm...
And he sat all that night 
through a terrible storm.
It poured and it lightninged!
It thundered! It rumbled!
"This isn't much fun,"
The poor elephant grumbled.
"I wish she'd come back 
'Cause I'm cold and I'm wet.
I hope that that Mayzie bird doesn't forget."

But Mayzie, by this time, was far beyond reach,
Enjoying the sunshine way off in Palm Beach,
And having such fun, such a wonderful rest,
Decided she'd NEVER go back to her nest!

So Horton kept sitting there, day after day.
And soon it was Autumn. The leaves blew away.
And then came the Winter... the snow and the sleet!
And icicles hung
From his trunk and his feet.
But Horton kept sitting, and said with a sneeze,
"I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it freeze.
I meant what I said
And I said what I meant...
An elephant's faithful
One hundred per cent!"

So poor Horton sat there
The whole winter through...
And then came the springtime
With troubles anew!
His friends gathered round
And they shouted with glee.
"Look! Horton the Elephant's
Up in a tree!"
They taunted. They teased him. 
They yelled, "How absurd!"
"Old Horton the Elephant
Thinks he's a bird!"

They laughed and they laughed. Then they all ran away.
And Horton was lonely. He wanted to play.
But he sat on the egg and continued to say:
"I meant what I said
And I said what I meant
An elephant's faithful
One hundred per cent!"

"No matter WHAT happens,
This egg must be tended!"
But poor Horton's troubles
Were far, far from ended.
For, while Horton sat there
So faithful, so kind,
Three hunters came sneaking
Up softly behind!

He heard the men's footsteps! 
He turned with a start!
Three rifles were aiming
Right straight at his heart!

Did he run?
He did not!
HORTON STAYED ON THAT NEST!
He held his head high
And he threw out his chest 
And he looked at the hunters
As much as to say:
"Shoot if you must
But I won't run away!
I meant what I said
And I said what I meant...
An elephant's faithful
One hundred per cent!"

But the men didn't shoot!
Much to Horton's surprise,
They dropped their three guns
And they stared with wide eyes! 
"Look!" they all shouted,
"Can such a thing be?
An elephant sitting on top of a tree..."

"It's strange! It's amazing! It's wonderful! New!
Don't shoot him. We'll CATCH him. That's just what we'll do!
Let's take him alive. Why, he's terribly funny!
We'll sell him back home to a circus, for money!"

And the first thing he knew, they had built a big wagon
With ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on.
They dug up his tree and they put it inside,
With Horton so sad that he practically cried.
"We're off!" the men shouted. And off they all went
With Horton unhappy, one hundred per cent.

Up out of the jungle! Up into the sky!
Up over the mountains ten thousand feet high!
Then down, down the mountains
And down to the sea
Went the cart with the elephant,
Egg, nest and tree...

Then out of the wagon
And onto a ship!
Out over the ocean...
And oooh, what a trip!
Rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray!
And Horton said, day after day after day,
"I meant what I said
And I said what I meant...
But oh, am I seasick!
One hundred per cent!"

After bobbing around for two weeks like a cork,
They landed at last in the town of New York.
"All ashore!" the men shouted,
And down with a lurch
Went Horton the Elephant
Still on his perch,
Tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him...
BUMP!
Horton landed!
And then the men sold him!

Sold to a circus! Then week after week
They showed him to people at ten cents a peek.
They took him to Boston, to Kalamazoo,
Chicago, Weehawken and Washington, too;
To Dayton, Ohio; St. Paul, Minnesota;
To Wichita, Kansas; to Drake, North Dakota.
And everywhere thousands of folks flocked to see
And laugh at the elephant up in a tree,
Poor Horton grew sadder the farther he went,
But he said as he sat in the hot noisy tent:
"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant
An elephant's faithful—one hundred per cent!"

Then... ONE DAY
The Circus Show happened to reach
A town way down south, not so far from Palm Beach.
And, dawdling along way up high in the sky,
Who (of all people!) should chance to fly by
But that old good-for-nothing bird, runaway Mayzie!
Still on vacation and still just as lazy.
And, spying the flags and the tents just below,
She sang out, "What fun! Why, I'll go to the show!"

And she swooped from the clouds
Through an open tent door...
"Good gracious!" gasped Mayzie,
"I've seen YOU before!"

Poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk!
He started to speak, but before he could talk...

There rang out the noisiest ear-splitting squeaks
From the egg that he'd sat on for fifty-one weeks!
A thumping! A bumping! A wild alive scratching!
"My egg!" shouted Horton. "MY EGG! WHY, IT'S HATCHING!"

"But it's MINE!" screamed the bird, when she heard the egg crack.
(The work was all done. Now she wanted it back.)
"It's MY egg!" she sputtered. "You stole it from me!
Get off of my nest and get out of my tree!"

Poor Horton backed down
With a sad, heavy heart....

But at that very instant, the egg burst apart!
And out of the pieces of red and white shell,
From the egg that he'd sat on so long and so well,
Horton the Elephant saw something whizz!
IT HAD EARS
AND A TAIL
AND A TRUNK JUST LIKE HIS!

And the people came shouting, "What's all this about...?"
They looked! And they stared with their eyes popping out!
Then they cheered and they cheered and they CHEERED more and more.
They'd never seen anything like it before!
"My goodness! My gracious!" they shouted. "MY WORD!
It's something brand new!
IT'S AN ELEPHANT-BIRD!!
And it should be, it should be, it SHOULD be like that!
Because Horton was faithful! He sat and he sat!
He meant what he said
And he said what he meant...."

... And they sent him home
Happy,
One hundred per cent!



If I Ran the Zoo

"It's a pretty good zoo,"
Said young Gerald McGrew, 
"And the fellow who runs it 
Seems proud of it too."

"But if I ran the zoo,"
Said young Gerald McGrew,
"I'd make a few changes. That's just what I'd do..."

The lions and tigers and that kind of stuff 
They have up here now are not quite good enough.
You see things like these in any old zoo. 
They're awfully old­-fashioned. I want something new! 

So I'd open each cage. I'll unlock every pen.
Let the animals go, and start over again. 
And somehow or other I think I could find 
Some beasts of some beasts of a more unusual kind.

A four­-footed lion's not much of a beast.
The one in my zoo will have ten feet, at least!
Five legs on the left and five more on the right.
Then people will stare, and they'll say, 'What a sight!
This Zoo Keeper, New Keeper Gerald's quite keen.
That's the gol-darndest lion I ever have seen!'

My New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, will make people talk.
My new zoo, McGrew zoo, will make people gawk
At the strangest odd creatures that ever did walk.
HI get, for my zoo, a new sort-of-a-hen
Who roosts in another hen's topknot, and then
Another one roosts in the topknot of his,
And another in his, and another in HIS,
And so forth and upward and onward, gee whizz!

But that's just a start. I'll do better than that.
They'll see me next day, in my zoo-keeper's hat,
Coming into my zoo with an Elephant-Cat!

They'll be so surprised they'll all swallow their gum. 
They'll ask, when they see my strange animals come,
"Where do you suppose he gets things like that from?"
His animals all have such very odd faces.
I'll bet he must hunt them in rather odd places!

And that's what I'll do,
Said young Gerald McGrew.

If you want to catch beasts you don't see every day,
You have to go places quite out of the way.
You have to go places no others can get to.
You have to get cold and you have to get wet, too.
Up past the North Pole, where the frozen winds squeal,
I JJ go and HI hunt in my Skeegle-mobile
And bring back a family of What-do-you-know!
And that's how my New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, will grow.

I'll hunt in the mountains of Zomba-ma-Tant
With helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant,
And capture a fine fluffy bird called the Bustard
Who only eats custard with sauce made of mustard.
And, also, a very fine beast called the Flustard
Who only eats mustard with sauce made of custard.

I'll catch 'em in caves, and I'll catch 'em in brooks, 
I'll catch 'em in crannies, I'll catch 'em in nooks 
That you don't read about in geography books.

Ill catch em in countries that no one can spell
Like the country of Motta-fa-Potta-fa-Pell.
In a country like that, if a hunter is clever,
He'll hunt up some beasts that you never saw ever!
 
I'll load up five boats with a family of Joats 
Whose feet are like cows, but wear squirrel­-skin coats
And sit down like dogs, but have voices like goats— 
Excepting they can't sing the very high notes. 

And then I'll go down to the Wilds of Nantucket, 
And capture a family of Lunks in a bucket. 
Then people will say, "Now I like that boy heaps. 
His New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, is growing by leaps.
He captures them wild, he captures them meek,
He captures them slim, he captures them sleek.
What do you suppose he will capture next week?"

I'll capture one tiny. I'll capture one cute.
I'll capture a deer that no hunter would shoot,
A deer that's so nice he could sleep m your bed
If it weren't for those horns that he has on his head.

And speaking of horns that are just a bit queer,
I'll bring back a very odd family of deer:
A father, a mother, two sisters, a brother
Whose horns are connected, from one to the other,
Whose horns are so mixed they can't tell them apart,
Can't tell where they end and can't tell where they start!
Each deer's mighty puzzled. He's never yet found
If his horns are hers, or the other way 'round.

I'll capture them fat and I'll capture them scrawny.
I'll capture a scraggle-foot Mulligatawny,
A high-stepping animal fast as the wind
From the blistering sands of the Desert of Zind.
This beast is the beast that the brave chieftains ride
When they wrant to go fast to find some place to hide.
A Mulligatawny is fine for my zoo
And so is a chieftain. I'll bring one back, too.

In the far western part 
Of south-east North Dakota
Lives a very fine animal
Called the Iota. 
But I'll capture one 
Who is even much finer 
In the north-eastern west part
Of South Carolina.

When people see him they will say, "Now by thunder!
This New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, is really a wonder!"

Most beasts are quite friendly, but still, in some lands
Some beasts are too dangerous to catch with bare hands. 
For those that are ugly and vicious and mean
I'll build a Bad-Animal-Catching-Machine.
It's rather expensive to build such a kit,
But with it a hunter can never get bit.

A zoo should have bugs, so I'll capture a Thwerll
Whose legs are snarled up in a terrible snerl.

And then I'll go out and I'll capture some Chuggs,
Some keen-shooter, mean-shooter, bean-shooter bugs.

I'll go to the African island of Yerka
And bring back a tizzle-topped Tufted Mazurka,
A kind of canary with quite a tall throat.
His neck is so long, if he swallows an oat
For breakfast the first day of April, they say
It has to go down such a very long way
That it gets to his stomach the fifteenth of May.

I'll bag a big bug
Who is very surprising,
A feller who has
A propeller for rising 
And zooming around
Making cross­-country hops, 
From Texas to Boston
With only two stops. 
Now that sort of thing
For a bug is just tops!

And when I've caught him,
Then the next thing you know
I'll go and I'll capture
A wild Tick-Tack-Toe,
With X's that win
And with Zeros that lose.
He'll look mighty good
In this Zoo of McGrew's.

I'll bring back a Gusset, a Gherkin, a Gasket
And also a Gootch from the wilds of Nantasket.

And eight Persian Princes will carry the basket,
But what their names are, I don't know. So don't ask it.

In a cave in Kartoom lives a beast called the Natch
That no other hunter's been able to catch. 
He's hidden for years in his cave with a pout
And no one's been able to make him come out.
But I'll coax him out with a wonderful meal
That's cooked by my cooks in my cooker mobile.

They'll fix up a dish that is just to his taste;
Three chicken croquettes made of library paste.
Then sprinkled with peanut shucks, pickled and spiced,
Then baked at 600 degrees and then iced.
It's mighty hard cooking to cook up such feasts
But that's how the New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, gets beasts.

I'll go to the far-away Mountains of Tobsk
Near the River of Nobsk, and I'll bring back an Obsk,
A sort of a kind of a Thing-a-ma-Bobsk
Who only eats rhubarb and corn-on-the-cobsk.
Then people will flock to my 200 in a mobsk.
"McGrew," they will say, "does a wonderful jobsk!
"He hunts with such vim and he hunts with such vigor. 
His new zoo, McGrew's Zoo, gets bigger and bigger!"

And, speaking of birds, there's the Russian Palooski,
Whose headski Is redski and belly is blueski.
I'll get one of them for Zooski McGrewski.

Then the whole town will gasp, "Why this boy never sleeps! 
No keeper before ever kept what he keeps. 
There's no telling WHAT that young fellow will do!"
And then, just to show them, I'll sail to Ka­-Troo 
And
Bring
Back
An It­kutch
A Preep
And a Proo
A Nerkle
A Nerd
And a Seersucker, too!

I'll hunt in the Jungles of Hippo-no-Hungus
And bring back a flock of wild Bippo-no-Bungus!
The Bippo-no-Bungus from Hippo-no-Hungus
Are better than those down in Dippo-no-Dungus
And smarter than those out in Nippo-no-Nungus.
And that's why I311 catch 'em in Hippo-no-Hungus
Instead of those others in Nungus and Dungus.
And people will say when they see these Bips bounding,
"This Zookeeper, New Keeper's simply astounding!
He travels so far that you'd think he would drop! 
When do you suppose this young fellow will stop?"

Stop...?
Well, I should. 
But I won't stop until
I've captures the Fizza­-ma­-Wizza­-ma­-Dill,
The world's biggest bird from the Island of Gwark 
Who only eats pine trees and spits out the bark. 
And boy! When I get him back home to my park, 
The whole world will say, 
"Young McGrew's made his mark.
He's built a zoo better than Noah's whole Ark!
These wonderful, marvelous beasts that he chooses
Have made him the greatest of all the McGrewses!"

"WOW!" They'll all cheer,
"What this zoo must be worth!
It's the gol-darndest zoo
On the face of the earth!"

"Yes...
That's what I'd do,"
Said young Gerald MeGrew.
"I'd make a few changes
If I ran the zoo."



Horton Hears a Who

On the fifteenth of May, in the jungle of Nool,
In the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool,
He was splashing... enjoying the jungle's great joys...
When Horton the elephant heard a small noise.

So Horton stopped splashing. He looked towards the sound.
"That's funny," thought Horton. "There's no one around."
Then he heard it again! Just a very faint yelp
As if some tiny person were calling for help.
"I'll help you," said Horton. "But who are you? Where?"
He looked and he looked. He could see nothing there
But a small speck of dust blowing past though the air.

"I say!" murmured Horton. "I've never heard tell
Of a small speck of dust that is able to yell.
So you know what I think?... Why, I think that there must
Be someone on top of that small speck of dust!
Some sort of a creature of very small size,
too small to be seen by an elephant's eyes...

"...some poor little person who's shaking with fear
That he'll blow in the pool! He has no way to steer!
I'll just have to save him. Because, after all,
A person's a person, no matter how small."

So, gently, and using the greatest of care,
The elephant stretched his great trunk through the air,
And he lifted the dust speck and carried it over
And placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover.

"Humpf!" humpfed a voice. 'Twas a sour Kangaroo.
And the young kangaroo in he pouch said "Humpf!" too
"Why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin.
A person on that?.. Why, there never has been!"

"Believe me," said Horton. "I tell you sincerely,
My ears are quite keen and I heard him quite clearly.
I know there's a person down there. And, what's more,
Quite likely there's two. Even three. Even four.
Quite likely...

"... a family, for all that we know!
A family with children just starting to grow.
So, please," Horton said, "as a favor to me,
Try not to disturb them. Just please let them be."

"I think you're a fool!" laughed the sour kangaroo
And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, "Me, too!
You're the biggest blame fool in the jungle of Nool!"
And the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool.
"What terrible splashing!" the elephant frowned.
"I can't let my very small persons get drowned!
I've got to protect them. I'm bigger than they."
So he plucked up the clover and hustled away.

Through the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread:
"He talks to a dust speck! He's out of his head!
Just look at him walk with that speck on the flower!"
And Horton walked, worrying, almost an hour.
"Should I put this speck down?..." Horton though with alarm.
"If I do, these small persons may come to great harm.
I can't put it down. And I won't! After all
A person's a person. No matter how small."

Then Horton stopped walking.
The speck-voice was talking!
The voice was so faint he could just barely hear it.
"Speak up, please," Said Horton. He put his ear near it.
"My friend," came the voice, "you're a very fine friend.
You've helped all us folks on this dust speck no end.
You've saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors.
You've saved all our churches and grocery stores."

"You mean..." Horton gasped, "you have buildings there, too?"
"Oh, yes," piped the voice. "We most certainly do...
"I know," called the voice, "I'm too small to be seen
But I'm Mayor of a town that is friendly and clean.
Our buildings, to you, would seem terribly small
But to us, who aren't big, they are wonderfully tall.
My town is called Who-ville, for I am a Who
And we Whos are all thankful and grateful to you"

And Horton called back to the Mayor of the town,
"You're safe now. Don't worry. I won't let you down."

But, just as he spoke to the Mayor of the speck,
Three big jungle monkeys climbed up Horton's neck!
The Wickersham Brothers came shouting, "What rot!
This elephant's talking to Whos who are not!
There aren't any Whos! And they don't have a Mayor!
And we're going to stop all this nonsense! So there!"

They snatched Horton's clover! They carried it off
To a black-bottomed eagle named Vlad Vlad-i-koff,
A mighty strong eagle, of very swift wing,
And they said, "Will you kindly get rid of this thing?"
And, before the poor elephant could even speak,
That eagle flew off with the flower in his beak.

All that late afternoon and far into the night
That black-bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight,
While Horton chased after, with groans, over stones
That tattered his toenails and battered his bones,
And begged, "Please don't harm all my little folks, who
Have as much right to live as us bigger folks do!"

But far, far beyond him, that eagle kept flapping
And over his shoulder called back, "Quit your yapping.
I'll fly the night through. I'm a bird. I don't mind it.
And I'll hide this, tomorrow, where you'll never find it!"

And at 6:56 the next morning he did it.
It sure was a terrible place that he hid it.
He let that small clover drop somewhere inside
Of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide!
"Find THAT!" sneered the bird. "But I think you will fail."
And he left
With a flip
Of his black-bottomed tail.

"I'll find it!" cried Horton. "I'll find it or bust!
I SHALL find my friends on my small speck of dust!"
And clover, by clover, by clover with care
He picked up and searched them, and called, "Are you there?"
But clover, by clover, by clover he found
That the one that he sought for was just not around.
And by noon poor old Horton, more dead than alive,
Had picked, searched, and piled up, nine thousand and five.

Then, on through the afternoon, hour after hour...
Till he found them at last! On the three millionth flower!
"My friends!" cried the elephant. "Tell me! Do tell!
Are you safe? Are you sound? Are you whole? Are you well?"

From down on the speck came the voice of the Mayor:
"We've really had trouble! Much more than our share.
When that black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped,
We landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped.
Our tea-pots are broken. Our rocking-chairs smashed.
And our bicycle tires all blew up when we crashed.
So, Horton, please!" pleaded that voice of the Mayor's,
"Will you stick by us Whos while we're making repairs?"

"Of course," Horton answered. "Of course I will stick.
I'll stick by you small folks though thin and though thick!"

"Humpf!" 
Humpfed a voice!
"For almost two days you've run wild and insisted
On chatting with persons who've never existed.
Such carryings-on in our peaceable jungle!
We've had quite enough of your bellowing bungle!
And I'm here to state," snapped the big kangaroo,
"That your silly nonsensical game is all through!"
And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, "Me, too!"

"With the help of the Wickersham Brothers and dozens
Of Wickersham Uncles and Wickershams Cousins
And Wickersham In-Laws, whose help I've engaged,
You're going to be roped! And you're going to be caged!
And, as for your dust speck...hah! That we shall boil
In a hot steaming kettle of Beezle-Nut oil!"
"Boil it?..." gasped Horton!
"Oh, that you can't do!
It's all full of persons!
They'll prove it to you!"

"Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!" Horton called. "Mr. Mayor!
You've got to prove that you really are there!
So call a big meeting. Get everyone out.
Make every Who holler! Make every Who shout!
Make every Who scream! If you don't, every Who
Is going to end up in a Beezle-Nut stew!"

And, down on the dust speck, the scared little Mayor
Quick called a big meeting in Who-ville Town Square.
And his people cried loudly. They cried out in fear:
"We are here! We are here! We are here! We are here!"

The elephant smiled: "That was clear as a bell.
You Kangaroos surely heard that very well."
"All I heard," snapped the big kangaroo, "was the breeze,
And the faint sound of wind through the far-distant trees.
I heard no small voices. And you didn't either."
And the you kangaroo in her pouch said, "Me, neither."

"Grab him!" they shouted. "And cage the big dope!
Lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope!
Tie the knots tight so he'll never shake lose!
Then dunk that dumb speck in the Beezle-Nut juice!"

Horton fought back with great vigor and vim
But the Wickersham gang was too many for him.
They beat him! They mauled him! They started to haul
Him into his cage! But he managed to call
To the Mayor: "Don't give up! I believe in you all
A person's a person, no matter how small!
And you very small persons will not have to die
If you make yourselves heard! So come on, now, and TRY!"

The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom. He started to smack it.
And, all over Who-ville, they whooped up a racket.
They rattled tin kettles! They beat on brass pans,
On garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans!
They blew on bazookas and blasted great toots
On clarinets, oom-pahs and boom-pahs and flutes!

Great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air.
They rattled and shook the whole sky! And the Mayor
Called up through the howling mad hullabaloo:
"Hey Horton! Hows this? Is our sound coming through?"

And Horton called back, "I can hear you just fine.
But the kangaroos' ears aren't as strong, quite, as mine.
They don't hear a thing! Are you sure all your boys
Are doing their best? Are they ALL making noise?
Are you sure every Who down in Who-ville is working?
Quick! Look through your town! Is there anyone shirking?"

Through the town rushed the Mayor, from the east to the west.
But everyone seemed to be doing his best.
Everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping!
Everyone seemed to be beeping or bipping!
But it wasn't enough, all this ruckus and roar!
He HAD to find someone to help him make more.
He raced through each building! He searched floor-to-floor!

And, just as he felt he was getting nowhere,
And almost about to give up in despair,
He suddenly burst through a door and that Mayor
Discovered one shirker! Quite hidden away
In the Fairfax Apartments (Apartment 12-J)
A very small, very small shirker named Jo-Jo
Was standing, just standing, and bouncing a Yo-Yo!
Not making a sound! Not a yipp! Not a chirp!
And the Mayor rushed inside and he grabbed the young twerp!

And he climbed with the lad up the Eiffelberg Tower.
"This," cried the Mayor, "is your towns darkest hour!
The time for all Whos who have blood that is red
To come to the aid of their country!" he said.
"We've GOT to make noises in greater amounts!
So, open your mouth, lad! For every voice counts!"

Thus he spoke as he climbed. When they got to the top,
The lad cleared his throat and he shouted out, "YOPP!"

And that Yopp...
That one small, extra Yopp put it over!
Finally, at last! From that speck on that clover
Their voices were heard! They rang out clear and clean.
And the elephant smiled. "Do you see what I mean?...
They've proved they ARE persons, no matter how small.
And their whole world was saved by the Smallest of All!"

"How true! Yes, how true," said the big kangaroo.
"And, from now on, you know what I'm planning to do?...
From now on, I'm going to protect them with you!"
And the young kangaroo in her pouch said...

"...ME, TOO!"
From the sun in the summer. From rain when it's fall-ish,
I'm going to protect them. No matter how small-ish!"



The Cat in the Hat

The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house
All that cold, cold, wet day.

I sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.
And I said, "how I wish
we had something to do!"

Too wet to go out
And too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
We did nothing at all.

So all we could do was to
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
And we did not like it.
Not one little bit.

And then
Something went BUMP!
How that bump made us jump!

We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
We looked!
And we saw him!
The Cat in the Hat!
And he said to us,
"Why do you sit there like that?"

"I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!"

"I know some good games we could play,"
Said the cat.
"I know some new tricks,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do."

Then Sally and I
Did not know what to say.
Our mother was out of the house
For the day.

But our fish said, "No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat
You do NOT want to play.
He should not be here.
He should not be about.
He should not be here
When your mother is out!"

"Now! Now! Have no fear.
Have no fear!" said the cat.
"My tricks are not bad,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"Why, we can have
lots of good fun, if you wish,
With a game that I call
Up-up-up with a fish!"

"Put me down!" said the fish.
"This is no fun at all!
Put me down!" said the fish.
"I do NOT wish to fall!"

"Have no fear!" said the cat.
"I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book one one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not ALL I can do!
Said the cat...

"Look at me!
Look at me now!" said the cat.
"With a cup and a cake
On the top of my hat!
I can hold up TWO books!
I can hold up the fish!
And a little toy ship!
And some milk on a dish!
And look!
I can hop up and down on the ball!
But that is not all!
Oh, no.
That is not all...

"Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun
But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup
And the milk and the cake!
I can hold up these books!
And the fish on a rake!
I can hold the toy ship
And a little toy man!
And look! With my tail
I can hold a red fan!
I can fan with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh, no.
That is not all..."

That is what the cat said...
Then he fell on his head!
He came down with a bump
From up there on the ball.
And Sally and I,
We saw ALL the things fall!

And our fish came down, too.
He fell into a pot!
He said, "Do I like this?
Oh, no! I do not.
This is not a good game,"
Said our fish as he lit.
"No, I do not like it,
Not one little bit!"

"Now look what you did!"
Said the fish to the cat.
"Now look at this house!
Look at this! Look at that!
You sank our toy ship,
Sank it deep in the cake.
You shook up our house
And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here
When our mother is not.
You get out of this house!"
Said the fish in the pot.

"But I like to be here.
Oh, I like it a lot!"
Said the Cat in the Hat
To the fish in the pot.
"I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to go!
And so," said the cat in the hat,
"So
so
so...
I will show you
Another good game that I know!"

And then he ran out.
And, then, fast as a fox,
The Cat in the Hat
Came back in with a box.

A big red wood box.
It was shut with a hook.
"Now look at this trick,"
Said the cat.
"Take a look!"

Then he got up on top
With a tip of his hat.
"I call this game fun-in-a-box,"
Said the cat.
"In this box are two things
I will show to you now.
You will like these two things,"
Said the cat with a bow.

"I will pick up the hook.
You will see something new.
Two things. And I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun."
Then, out of the box
Came Thing Two and Thing One!
And they ran to us fast.
They said, "How do you do?
Would you like to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two?"

And Sally and I
Did not know what to do.
So we had to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two.
We shook their two hands.
But our fish said, "No! No!
Those Things should not be
In this house! Make them go!

"They should not be here
When your mother is not!
Put them out! Put them out!"
Said the fish in the pot.

"Have no fear, little fish,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"These Things are good Things."
And he gave them a pat.
"They are tame. Oh, so tame!
They have come here to play.
They will give you some fun
On this wet, wet, wet day."

Now, here is a game that they like,"
Said the cat.
"They like to fly kites,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.

"No! Not in the house!"
Said the fish in the pot.
"They should not fly kites
In a house! They should not.
Oh, the things they will bump!
Oh, the things they will hit!
Oh, I do not like it!
Not one little bit!"

Then Sally and I
Saw them run down the hall.
We saw those two Things
Bump their kites on the wall!
Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Down the wall in the hall.

Thing Two and Thing One!
They ran up! They ran down!
On the string of one kite
We saw Mother's new gown!
Her gown with the dots
That are pink, white and red.
Then we saw one kite bump
On the head of her bed!

Then those things ran about
with big bumps, jumps and kicks
And with hops and big thumps
And all kinds of bad tricks.
And I said,
"I do NOT like the way that they play!
If Mother could see this,
Oh, what would she say!"

Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
And our fish shook with fear.
"Your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh, what will she do to us?
What will she say?
Oh, she will not like it
To find us this way!"

"So DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
"Do you hear!
I saw her. Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So, as fast as you can,
Think of something to do!
You will have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing Two!"

So, as fast as I could,
I went after my net.
And I said, "With my net
I can get them I bet.
I bet, with my net,
I can get those things yet!"

Then I let down my net.
It came down with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Those two Things had to stop.
Then I said to the cat,
"Now you do as I say.
You pack up those Things
And you take them away!"

"Oh dear!" said the cat.
"You did not like our game...
Oh dear.
What a shame!
What a shame!
What a shame!"

Then he shut up the Things
In the box with the hook.
And the cat went away
With a sad kind of look.

"That is good," said the fish.
"He has gone away. Yes.
But your mother will come.
She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big
And so deep and so tall,
We can not pick it up.
There is no way at all!"

And THEN!
Who was back in the house?
Why, the cat!
"Have no fear of this mess,"
Aaid the Cat in the Hat.
"I always pick up all my playthings
And so...
I will show you another
Good trick that I know!"

Then we saw him pick up
All the things that were down.
He picked up the cake,
And the rake, and the gown,
And the milk, and the strings,
And the books, and the dish,
And the fan, and the cup,
And the ship, and the fish.
And he put them away.
Then he said, "That is that."
And then he was gone
With a tip of his hat.

Then our mother came in
And she said to us two,
"Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?"

And Sally and I did not know
What to say.
Should we tell her
The things that went on there that day?

Should we tell her about it?
Now, what SHOULD we do?
Well...
What would YOU do
If your mother asked YOU?



How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Every Who
Down in Who-ville
Liked Christmas a lot...

But the Grinch,
Who lived just North of Who-ville
Did NOT!

The Grinch hated Christmas!
The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.

But,
Whatever the reason,
Wis heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos,
Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown
At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Who-ville beneath
Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.

"And they're hanging their stockings," he snarled with a sneer.
"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
"I must find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"

For,
Tomorrow, he knew...

All the Who girls and boys
Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!
And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!
There's one thing he hated! The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!

Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.
And they'd feast! And they'd feast!
And they'd FEAST!
FEAST!
FEAST!
FEAST!
They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast-beast
Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!

And THEN
They'd do something
He liked least of all!
Every Who down in Who-vill, the tall and the small,
Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!

And they'd sing! And they'd sing!
AND they'd SING! SING! SING! SING!
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who-Christmas-Sing,
The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!
"Why for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
"I must stop Christmas from coming!
...But how?"

Then he got an idea!
An awful idea!
THE GRINCH
GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!

"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!
"With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!"

"All I need is a reindeer..."
The Grinch looked around.
But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Did that stop the old Grinch...?
No! The Grinch simply said,
"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
So he called his dog, Max. Then took some read thread
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.

THEN
He loaded some bags
And some old empty sacks
On a ramshackle sleigh
And he hitched up old Max.

Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!"
And the sleigh started down
Toward the homes where the Whos
Lay a-snooze in their town.

All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care
When he came to the first little house on the square.
"This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed
And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.

Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue
Where the little Who stockings hung all in a row.
"These stockings," he grinched, "are the first things to go!"

Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Around the whole room, and he took every present!
Pop guns! And bicyles! Roller skates! Drums!
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,
Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!

Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that Grinch even took the last can of Who-hash!

Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
"And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"

As the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!
Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two.

The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter
Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,
Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"

But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,
He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
"Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,
"There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side.
So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear.
I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."

And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head
And he got her a drink, and he sent her to bed.
And when Cindy-Lou Who was in bed with her cup,
He went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!

Then the last thing he took
Was the log for their fire!
Then he went up the chimney himself, the old liar.
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.

And the one speck of food
That he left in the house
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.

Then
He did the same thing
To the other Whos' houses,

Leaving crumbs
Much too small
For the other Whos' mouses!

It was quarter past dawn...
All the Whos still a-bed,
All the Whos still a-snooze,
When he packed up his sled,
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!

Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
"Pooh-pooh to the Whos!" he was grinch-ish-ly humming.
"They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
"Then the Whos down in Who-ville will all cry BOO-HOO!

"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch,
"That I simply MUST hear!"
So he paused. And the Grinch put a hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low. Then it started to grow...

But this sound wasn't sad!
Why, this sound sounded merry!
It coulnd't be so!
But it WAS merry! VERY!

He stared down at Who-ville!
The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook!
What he saw was a shocking surprise!

Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing! Eithout any presents at all!

He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming!
IT CAME!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

And the Grinch, with his grinch feet ice-cold in the snow,
Stood puzzling and puzzling. "How could it be so?
It came without ribbons! It came without tags!
It came without packages, boxes, or bags!"
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!
"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store.
"Maybe Christmas... perhaps... means a little bit more!"

And what happened then...?
Well... in Who-ville they say
That the Grinch's small heart
Grew three sizes that day!

And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
And he...

...HE HIMSELF...!
The Grinch carved the roast beast!

Through three cheese trees
three free fleas flew.
While these fleas flew,
freezy breeze blew.
Freezy breeze made
these three trees freeze.
Freezy trees made
these trees' cheese freeze.
That's what made these
three free fleas sneeze.

Stop it! Stop it!
That's enough, sir.
I can't say
such silly stuff, sir.

Very well, then,
Mr. Knox, sir.

Let's have a little talk

Green Eggs and Ham

I am Sam

Sam I am

That Sam-I-am!
That Sam-I-am!

One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish

One fish
two fish
red fish
blue fish.

Black fish
blue fish
old fish
new fish.

This one has
a little star.

This one has a little car.
Say! What a lot
of fish there are.

Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.
Some are old. And some are new.

Some are sad.
And some are glad.

And some are very, very bad.

Why are they
sad and glad and bad?
I do not know.
Go ask your dad.

Some are thin.
And some are fat.
The fat one has
a yellow hat.

From there to here,
from here to there,
funny things
are everywhere.

Here are some
who like to run.
They run for fun
in the hot, hot sun.

Oh me! Oh my!
Oh me! oh my!
What a lot
of funny things go by.

Some have two feet
and some have four.
Some have six feet
and some have more.

Where do they come from? I can't say.
But I bet they have come
a long, long way.

we see them come.
We see them go.

Some are fast.
And some are slow.

Some are high.
And some are low.

Not one of them
is like another.
Don't ask us why.
Go ask your mother.

Say!
Look at his fingers!
One, two, three...
How many fingers
do I see?

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.
He has eleven!

Eleven!
This is something new.
I wish I had
eleven, too!

Bump!
Bump!
Bump!
Did you ever ride a Wump?
We have a Wump
with just one hump.

But
we know a man
called Mr. Gump.
Mr. Gump has a seven hump Wump.
So...
if you like to go Bump! Bump!
just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump.

Who am I?
My name is Ned.
I do not like
my little bed.

This is no good.
This is not right.
My feet stick out
of bed all night.

And when I pull them in,
Oh, Dear!
My head sticks out of bed
up here!

We like our bike.
It is made for three.
Our Mike
sits up in back,
you see.

We like our Mike,
and this is why:
Mike does all the work
when the hills get high.

Hello there, Ned.
How do you do?
Tell me, tell me
what is new?
How are things
in your little bed?
What is new?
Please tell me, Ned.

I do not like
this bed at all.
a lot of things
have come to call.
A cow, a dog, a cat, a mouse.
Oh! What a bed! Oh! What a house!

Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I cannot hear.
Will you please
come over near?
Will you please look in my ear?
There must be something there, I fear.

Say look!
A bird was in your ear.
But he is out. So have no fear.
Again your ear can hear, my dear.

My hat is old.
My teeth are gold.

I have a bird
I like to hold.

My shoe is off.
My foot is cold.

My shoe is off.
My foot is cold.

I have a bird
I like to hold.

My hat is old.
My teeth are gold.

And now
my story
is all told.

We took a look.
We saw a Nook.
On his head
he had a hook.
On his hook
he had a book.
On his book
was "How to Cook."

We saw him sit
and try to cook.
He took a look
at the book on the hook.

But a Nook can't read,
so a Nook can't Cook.
SO...
What good to a Nook
is a hook cook book?

The moon was out
and we saw some sheep.
We saw some sheep
take a walk in their sleep.

By the light of the moon,
by the light of a star,
They walked all night
from near to far.

I would never walk.
I would take a car.

I do not like
this one so well.
All he does
is yell, yell, yell.
I will not have this one about.
When he comes in
I put him out.

This one is
quiet as a mouse.
I like to have him
in the house.

At our house
we open cans.
We have to open
many cans.
And that is why
we have a Zans.

A Zans for cans
is very good.
Have you a Zans for cans?
You should.

I like to box.
How I like to box!
So, every day,
I box a Gox.

In yellow socks
I box my Gox.
I box in yellow
Gox box socks.

It is fun to sing
if you sing with a Ying.
My Ying can sing
like anything.

I sing high
and my Ying sings low.
And we are not too bad,
you know.

This one,
I think,
is called
a Yink.

He likes to wink, 
he likes to drink.

He likes to drink, and drink, and drink.
the thing he likes to drink
is ink.
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
He likes to wink and drink pink ink.

SO...
If you have a lot of ink,
then you should get
a Yink, I think.

Hop! Hop! Hop!
I am a Yop.
All I like to do is hop,
from finger top
to finger top.

I hop from left to right
and then...
Hop! Hop!
I hop right back again.

I like to hop
all day and night
from right to left
and left to right.

Why do I like to
hop, hop, hop?
I do not know.
Go ask your Pop.

Brush! Brush!
Brush! Brush!

Comb! Comb!
Comb! Comb!

Blue hair
is fun
to brush and comb.

All girls who like
to brush and comb
should have a pet
like this at home.

Who is this pet?
Say!
He is wet.

You never yet
met a pet,
I bet,
as wet as they let
this wet pet get.

Did you ever
fly a kite
in bed?

Did you ever walk
with ten cats
on your head?

Did you ever milk
this kind of cow?
Well, we can do it.
We know how.

If you never did,
you should.
These things are fun
and fun is good.

Hello!
Hello! 
Are you there?
Hello!
I called you up
to say hello.
I said Hello.
Can you hear me, Joe?

Oh no,
I cannot hear your call.
I cannot hear your call at all.
This is not good
and I know why.
A mouse has cut the wire.
Good-by!

From near to far,
from here to there,
funny things are everywhere.

These yellow pets
are called the Zeds.
They have one hair
upon their heads.
Their hair grows fast...
so fast, they say,
they need a haircut
every day.

Who am I?
My name is Ish.
On my hand I have a dish.

I have this dish
to help me wish.

When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish.
Then I say, "I wish for fish!"
And I get fish right on my dish.

So...
If you wish to wish a wish,
you may swish for fish
with my Ish wish dish.

At our house
we play out back.
We play a game
called ring the Gack.

Would you like to play this game?
Come down!
We have the only
Gack in town.

Look what we found
in the park
in the dark.
We will take him home.
We will call him Clark.

He will live at our house.
He will grow and grow.
Will our mother like this?
We don't know.

And now
good night.
It is time to sleep.
So we will sleep
with our pet Zeep.

Today is gone. Today was fun.
Tomorrow is another one.
Every day,
from here to there.
funny things are everywhere.



The Cat in the Hat Comes Back

This was no time for play. 
This was no time for fun.
This was no time for games.
There was work to be done.

All that deep, 
Deep, deep snow,
All that snow had to go.

When our mother went 
Down to the town for the day, 
She said, "Somebody has to
Clean all this away.
Somebody, SOMEBODY
Has to, you see."
Then she picked out two Somebodies. 
Sally and me.

Well...
There we were.
We were working like that 
And then who should come up
But the CAT IN THE HAT! 

"Oh-oh!" Sally said. 
"Don't you talk to that cat. 
That cat is a bad one, 
That Cat in the Hat. 
He plays lots of bad tricks. 
Don't you let him come near. 
You know what he did
The last time he was here."

"Play tricks?" laughed the cat.
"Oh, my my! No, no, no!
I just want to go in 
To get out of the snow.
Keep your mind on your work.
You just stay there, you two.
I will go in the house
And find something to do."

Then that cat went right in! 
He was up to no good! 
So I ran in after
As fast as I could!

Do you know where I found him? 
You know where he was? 
He was eating a cake in the tub! 
Yes he was! 
The hot water was on 
And the cold water, too. 
And I said to the cat, 
"What a bad thing to do!" 

"But I like to eat cake 
In a tub," laughed the cat. 
"You should try it some time,"
Laughed the cat as he sat.

And then I got mad. 
This was no time for fun. 
I said, "Cat! You get out! 
There is work to be done.
I have no time for tricks. 
I must go back and dig. 
I can't have you in here 
Eating cake like a pig! 
You get out of this house! 
We don't want you about!" 
Then I shut off the water 
And let it run out. 

The water ran out. 
And then I SAW THE RING! 
A ring in the tub!
And, oh boy! What a thing! 
A big long pink cat ring!
It looked like pink ink! 
And I said, "Will this ever 
Come off? I don't think!" 

"Have no fear of that ring," 
Laughed the Cat in the Hat.
"Why, I can take cat rings
Off tubs. Just like that!

Do you know how he did it? 
WITH MOTHER'S WHITE DRESS! 
Now the tub was all clean, 
But her dress was a mess! 

Then Sally looked in. 
Sally saw the dress, too! 
And Sally and I
Did not know what to do.
We should work in the snow.
But that dress! What a spot!
"It may never come off!"
Sally said. "It may not!"

But the cat laughed, "Ho! Ho! 
I can make the spot go. 
The way I take spots off a dress 
Is just so!"

"See here!" laughed the cat. 
"It is not hard at all. 
The thing that takes spots 
Off a dress is a wall!"
Then we saw the cat wipe 
The spot off the dress. 
Now the dress was all clean. 
But the wall! What a mess! 

"Oh, wall spots!" he laughed. 
"Let me tell you some news. 
To take spots off a wall,
All I need is two shoes!" 

Whose shoes did he use? 
I looked and saw whose!
And I said to the cat,
"This is very bad news.
Now the spot is all over
DAD'S $10 SHOES!"

"But your dad will not
Know about that,"
Said the cat.
"He will never found out,"
Laughed the Cat in the Hat. 
"His $10 shoes will have 
No spots at all.
I will rub them right off 
On this rug in the hall."

"But now we have rug spots!' 
I yelled. "What a day!
Rug spots! What next?
Can you take THEM away?" 

"Don't ask me," he laughed. 
"Why, you know that I can!" 
Then he picked up the rug 
And away the cat ran.

"I can clean up these rug spots 
Before you count three! 
No spots are too hard
For a Hat Cat like me!"

He ran into Dad's bedroom 
And then the cat said,
"It is good that your dad 
Has the right kind of bed."

Then he shook the rug! 
CRACK! 
Now the bed had the spot! 
And all I could say was, 
"Now what, Cat? 
NOW what?"

But the cat just stood still.
He just looked at the bed. 
"This is NOT the right kind of a bed," 
The cat said. 
"To take spots off THIS bed 
Will be hard," said the cat. 
"I can't do it alone," 
Said the Cat in the Hat.

"It is good I have some one 
To help me," he said. 
"Right here in my hat
On the top of my head!
It is good that I have him 
Here with me today. 
He helps me a lot. 
This is Little Cat A."

And then Little Cat A 
Took the hat off HIS head. 
"It is good I have some one 
To help ME," he said. 
"This is Little Cat B. 
And I keep him about, 
And when I need help 
Then I let him come out." 

And then B said, 
"I think we need Little Cat C. 
That spot is too much 
For the A cat and me. 
But now, have no fear! 
We will clean it away!
The three of us! Little Cats B, C and A!"

"Come on! Take it away!" 
Yelled Little Cat A. 

"I will hit that old spot 
With this broom! Do you see? 
It comes of the old bed!
It goes on the T.V."

And then Little Cat B 
Cleaned up the T.V. 

He cleaned it with milk, 
Put the spot in a pan!
And then C blew it out
Of the house with a fan!

"But look where it went!" 
I said. "Look where it blew! 
You blew the mess 
Out of the house. That is true. 
But now you made Snow Spots! 
You can't let THEM stay!" 

"Let us think about that now," 
Said C, B and A. 

"With some help, we can do it!" 
Said Little Cat C. 
Then POP! On his head 
We saw Little Cat D!

Then, POP! POP! POP!
Little Cats E, F and G!

"We will clean up that snow 
If it takes us all day! 
If it takes us all night, 
We will clean it away!" 
Said Little Cats G, F, E, D, C, B, A.

They ran out of the house then 
And we ran out, too.
And the Big Cat laughed, 
"Now you will see something new! 
My cats are all clever.
My cats are good shots.
My cats have good guns.
They will kill all those spots!"

But this did not look
Very clever to me. 
Kill snow spots with pop guns? 
That just could not be! 

"All this does is make MORE spots!" 
We yelled at the cat.
"Your cats are no good.
Put them back in your hat.

"Take your Little Cats G,
F, E, D, C, B, A.
Put them back in your hat 
And you take them away!" 

"Oh, no!" said the cat. 
"All they need is more help. 
Help is all that they need.
So keep still and don't yelp." 

Then Little Cat G
Took the hat off his head.
"I have Little Cat H
Here to help us," he said.

"Little Cats H, I, J, 
K, L and M.
But our work is so hard
We must have more than them.
We need Little Cat N.
We need O. We need P. 
We need Little Cats Q, R, S, T,
U and V."

"Come on! Kill those spots! 
Kill the mess!" yelled the cats.
And they jumped at the snow 
With long rakes and red bats.
They put it in pails
And they made high pink hills!
Pink snow men! Pink snow balls!
And little pink pills!

Oh, the things that they did!
And they did them so hard,
It was all one big spot now
All over the yard!
But the Big Cat stood there
And he said, "This is good.
This is what they should do
And I knew that they would.

"With a little more help,
All the work will be done.
They need one more cat.
And I know just the one."

"Look close! In my hand
I have Little Cat V.
On his head are Cats W,
X, Y and Z."

"Z is too small to see. 
So don't try. You can not.
But Z is the cat
Who will clean up that spot!"

"Now here is the Z 
You can't see," said the Cat. 
"And I bet you can't guess 
What he has in HIS hat!

"He has something called VOOM.
Voom is so hard to get,
You never saw anything
Like it, I bet.
Why, Voom cleans up anything 
Clean as can be!"
Then he yelled,
"Take your hat off now, 
Little Cat Z!
Take the Voom off your head!
Make it clean up the snow!
Hurry! You Little Cat!
One! Two! Three! GO!"

Then the Voom...
It went VOOM!
And, ob boy! What a VOOM!

Now, don't ask me what Voom is. 
I never will know.
But, boy! Let me tell you 
It DOES clean up snow!

"So you see!" laughed the Cat, 
"Now your snow is all white! 
Now your work is all done! 
Now your house is all right! 
And you know where my little cats are?" 
Said the cat. 
"That Voom blew my little cats 
Back in my hat.
And so, if you ever 
Have spots, now and then,
I will be very happy 
To come here again...

"...with Little Cats A, B, C, D..
E, F, G...
H, I, J, K...
L, M, N...
and O, P..

..and Q, R, S, T...
and Cat U and Cat V...
and Little Cats W 
X 
Y 
and Z!"



The Lorax

At the far end of town
where the Grickle-grass grows
and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows
and no birds ever sing excepting old crows...
is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.

And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say,
if you look deep enough you can still see, today,
where the Lorax once stood
just as long as it could
before somebody lifted the Lorax away.

What was the Lorax?
Any why was it there?
And why was it lifted and taken somewhere
from the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows?
The old Once-ler still lives here.
Ask him. He knows.

You won't see the Once-ler.
Don't knock at his door.
He stays in his Lerkim, on top of his store.
He stays in his Lerkim, cold under the roof,
where he makes his own clothes
out of miff-muffered moof.
And on special dank midnights in August,
he peeks
out of the shutters
and sometimes he speaks
and tells how the Lorax was lifted away.

He'll tell you, perhaps...
if you're willing to pay.

On the end of a rope
he lets down a tin pail
and you have to toss in fifteen cents
and a nail
and the shell of a great-great-great-
grandfather snail.

Then he pulls up the pail,
makes a most careful count
to see if you've paid him
the proper amount.

Then he hides what you paid him
away in his Snuvv,
his secret strange hole
in his gruvvulous glove.

Then he grunts, "I will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone,
for the secrets I tell are for your ears alone."

SLUPP!
Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear
and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,
since they have to come down
through a snergely hose,
and he sounds
as if he had
smallish bees up his nose.

"Now I'll tell you," he says, with his teeth sounding gray,
"how the Lorax got lifted and taken away...

It all started way back...
such a long, long time back...

Way back in the days when the grass was still green
and the pond was still wet
and the clouds were still clean,
and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space...
one morning, I came to this glorious place.
And I first saw the trees!
The Truffula Trees!
The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees!
Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze.

And, under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits
as the played in the shade and ate Truffula Fruits.

From the rippulous pond
came the comfortable sound
of the Humming-Fish humming
while splashing around.

But those trees! Those trees!
Those Truffula Trees!
All my life I'd been searching
for trees such as these.
The touch of their tufts
was much softer than silk.
And they had the sweet smell
of fresh butterfly milk. 

I felt a great leaping
of joy in my heart.
I knew just what I'd do!
I unloaded my cart.

In no time at all, I had built a small shop.
Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop.
And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed,
I took the soft tuft. And I knitted a Thneed!

The instant I'd finished I heard a ga-Zump!
I looked.
I saw something pop out of a stump
of the tree I'd chopped down. It was sort of a man.
Describe him?... That's hard. I don't know if I can.

He was shortish. And oldish.
And brownish. And mossy.
And he spoke with a voice
that was sharpish and bossy.

"Mister!" he said with a sawdusty sneeze,
"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.
I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.
And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs"-
he was very upset as he shouted and puffed-
"What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?"

"Look, Lorax," I said. "There's no cause for alarm.
I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm.
I'm being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed.
A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!
It's a shirt. It's a sock. It's a glove. It's a hat.
But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that.
You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!
Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats!"

The Lorax said,
"Sir! You are crazy with greed.
There is no one on earth
who would buy that fool Thneed!"

But the very next minute I proved he was wrong.
For, just at that minute, a chap came along,
and he thought that the Thneed I had knitted was great.
He happily bought it for three ninety-eight.

I laughed at the Lorax, "You poor stupid guy!
You never can tell what some people will buy."

"I repeat," cried the Lorax,
"I speak for the trees!"

"I'm busy," I told him.
"Shut up, if you please."

I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all,
built a radiophone. I put in a quick call.
I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts
and I said, "Listen here! Here's a wonderful chance
for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich! 
Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch.
Turn left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stitch."

And, in no time at all,
in the factory I built,
the whole Once-ler Family
was working full tilt.
We were all knitting Thneeds
just as busy as bees,
to the sound of the chopping
of Truffula Trees.

Then...
Oh! Baby! Oh!
How my business did grow!
Now, chopping one tree
at a time
was too slow. 

So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker,
which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.
We were making Thneeds
four times as fast as before!
And that Lorax?...
He didn't show up any more.

But the next week
he knocked
on my new office door.

He snapped, "I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please.
But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots
who played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits
and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.

"NOW...thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground,
there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round.
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies
because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!

"They loved living here. But I can't let them stay.
They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may.
Good luck, boys," he cried. And he sent them away.

I, the Once-ler, felt sad
as I watched them all go.
BUT...
business is business!
And business must grow
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.

I meant no harm. I most truly did not.
But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got.
I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads.
I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads
of the Thneeds I shipped out. I was shipping them forth
to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!
I went right on biggering... selling more Thneeds.
And I biggered my money, which everyone needs. 

Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes
when that old nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.

"I am the Lorax," he coughed and he whiffed.
He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed.
"Once-ler!" He cried with a cruffulous croak.
"Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!
My poor Swomee-Swans... why, they can't sing a note!
No one can sing who has smog in his throat.

"And so," said the Lorax,
"-please pardon my cough-
they cannot live here.
So I'm sending them off.

"Where will they go?...
I don't hopefully know.

They may have to fly for a month... or a year...
To escape from the smog you've smogged-up around here.

"What's more," snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.)
"Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.
Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop
making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp.
And what do you do with this leftover goo?...
I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!

You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed!
No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed.
So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary.
They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary
in search of some water that isn't so smeary."

And then I got mad.
I got terribly mad.
I yelled at the Lorax, "Now listen here, Dad!
All you do is yap-yap and say, 'Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!'
Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you
I intend to go on doing just what I do!
And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering
on biggering 
and BIGGERING
and BIGGERING
and BIGGERING,
Turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneeds
which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!"

And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!
From outside in the fields came a sickening smack
of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall.
The very last Truffula Tree of them all!

No more trees. No more Thneeds. No more work to be done.
So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one,
all waved me good-bye. They jumped into my cars
and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.

Now all that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky
was my big empty factory...
the Lorax...
and I.

The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance...
just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance...
as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.
And I'll never forget the grim look on his face
when he hoisted himself and took leave of this place,
through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.

And all that the Lorax left here in this mess
was a small pile of rocks, with one word...
"UNLESS."
Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.

That was long, long ago.
But each day since that day
I've sat here and worried
and worried away.
Through the years, while my buildings
have fallen apart,
I've worried about it
with all of my heart.

"But now," says the Once-ler,
Now that you're here,
the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear.
UNLESS someone like you
cares a whole awful lot,
nothing is going to get better.
It's not.

"SO...
Catch!" calls the Once-ler.
He lets something fall.
"It's a Truffula Seed.
It's the last one of all!
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds.
And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.
Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care.
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.
Then the Lorax
and all of his friends
may come back."



Yertle the Turtle

On the far-away island of Sala-ma-Sond,
Yertle the Turtle was king of the pond.
A nice little pond. It was clean. It was neat.
The water was warm. There was plenty to eat.
The turtles had everything turtles might need.
And they were all happy. Quite happy indeed.

They were... until Yertle, the king of them all,
Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small.
"I'm ruler", said Yertle, "of all that I see.
But I don't see enough. That's the trouble with me.
With this stone for a throne, I look down on my pond
But I cannot look down on the places beyond.
This throne that I sit on is too, too low down.
It ought to be higher!" he said with a frown.
"If I could sit high, how much greater I'd be!
What a king! I'd be ruler of all that I see!"

So Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand
And Yertle, the Turtle King, gave a command.
He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone
And, using these turtles, he built a new throne.
He made each turtle stand on another one's back
And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack.
And then Yertle climbed up. He sat down on the pile.
What a wonderful view! He could see 'most a mile!

"All mine!" Yertle cried. "Oh, the things I now rule!
I'm the king of a cow! And I'm the king of a mule!
I'm the king of a house! And, what's more, beyond that,
I'm the king of a blueberry bush and a cat!
I'm Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!
For I am the ruler of all that I see!"

And all through the morning, he sat there up high
Saying over and over, "A great king am I!"
Until 'long about noon. Then he heard a faint sigh.
"What's that?" snapped the king
And he looked down the stack.
And he saw, at the bottom, a turtle named Mack.
Just a part of his throne. And this plain little turtle
Looked up and he said, "Beg your pardon, King Yertle.
I've pains in my back and my shoulders and knees.
How long must we stand here, Your Majesty, please?"

"SILENCE!" the King of the Turtles barked back.
"I'm king, and you're only a turtle named Mack."

"You stay in your place while I sit here and rule.
I'm king of a cow! And I'm king of a mule!
I'm king of a house! And a bush! And a cat!
But that isn't all. I'll do better than that!
My throne shall be higher!" his royal voice thundered,
"So pile up more turtles! I want 'bout two hundred!"

"Turtles! More turtles!" he bellowed and brayed.
And the turtles 'way down in the pond were afraid.
They trembled. They shook. But they came. They
obeyed.
From all over the pond, they came swimming by
dozens.
Whole families of turtles, with uncles and cousins.
And all of them stepped on the head of poor Mack.
One after another, they climbed up the stack.

THEN Yertle the Turtle was perched up so high,
He could see fourty miles from his throne in the sky!
"Hooray!" shouted Yertle. "I'm the king of the trees!
I'm king of the birds! And I'm king of the bees!
I'm king of the butterflies! King of the air!
Ah, me! What a throne! What a wonderful chair!
I'm Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!
For I am the ruler of all that I see!"

Then again, from below, in the great heavy stack,
Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack.
"Your Majesty, please... I don't like to complain,
But down here below, we are feeling great pain.
I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,
But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights.
We turtles can't stand it. Our shells will all crack!
Besides, we need food. We are starving!" groaned Mack.

"You hush up your mouth!" howled the mighty King
Yertle.
"You've no right to talk to the world's highest turtle.
I rule from the clouds! Over land! Over sea!
There's nothing, no, NOTHING, that's higher than me!"

But, while he was shouting, he saw with suprise
That the moon of the evening was starting to rise
Up over his head in the darkening skies.
"What's THAT?" snorted Yertle. "Say, what IS that thing
That dares to be higher than Yertle the King?
I shall not allow it! I'll go higher still!
I'll build my throne higher! I can and I will!
I'll call some more turtles. I'll stack 'em to heaven!
I need 'bout five thousand, six hundred and seven!"

But, as Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand
And started to order and give the command,
That plain little turtle below in the stack,
That plain little turtle whose name was just Mack,
Decided he'd taken enough. And he had.
And that plain little lad got a bit mad.
And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing.
He burped!
And his burp shook the throne of the king!

And Yertle the Turtle, the king of the trees,
The king of the air and the birds and the bees,
The king of a house and a cow and a mule...
Well, that was the end of the Turtle King's rule!
For Yertle, the King of all Sala-ma-Sond,
Fell off his high throne and fell Plunk! in the pond!

And tosay the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,
Is King of the Mud. That is all he can see.
And the turtles, of course... all the turtles are free
As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be.



Oh, the Places You'll Go!

Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.

It's opener there
in the wide open air.

Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.

And when things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.

OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on your way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.

You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.

I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.

You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.

You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.

And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?

And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...

...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

NO!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying.
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.

I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.

All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.

And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.

But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.

On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.

And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!
(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)

KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!

So...
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,
You're off the Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting.
So... get on your way!



There's a Wocket in my Pocket

Did you
ever have the feeling
there's a WASKET
in your BASKET?

... Or a NUREAU
in your BUREAU?

... Or a WOSET in your CLOSET?

Sometimes
I feel quite CERTAIN
there's a JERTAIN
in the CURTAIN.

Sometimes
I have a feeling
there's a ZLOCK
behind the ClOCK.

And that ZELF
up on that SHELF!

I have
talked to him
myself.

That's the
kind of house
I live in.

There's a NINK
in the SINK.

And a
ZAMP
in the
LAMP.

And they're
rather nice
...I think.

Some of them
are very friendly.
Like the
YOT
in the
POT.

But that
YOTTLE
in
the
BOTTLE!

Some are friendly
Some are NOT.

I like the
ZABLE
on the
TABLE.

And the
GHAIR under the CHAIR.

But that BOFA
on the SOFA...

Well,
I wish
he wasn't there.

All those NUPBOARDS
in the CUPBOARDS.
They're good fun
to have about.

But that
NOOTH GRUSH
on my
TOOTH BRUSH...

Him
I could
do without!

The only one
I'm really scared of
is that VUG
under the RUG.

And that QUIMNEY
up the CHIMNEY...

I don't like him.
Not at all.
 
And it makes me sort of nervous
when the ZALL scoots down the HALL.

But the YEPS
on the STEPS-

They're great fun
to have around.

And so are
many, many
other friends
that I have found....

...Like the TELLAR
and the NELLAR
and the GELLAR
and the DELLAR
and the BELLAR
and the WELLAR
and the ZELLAR
in the CELLAR.

...And the GEELING
on the CEILING...

...and
the
ZOWER
in
my
SHOWER...

...and the ZILLOW
on my PILLOW.

I don't care
if you believe it.
That's the kind of house
I live in.
And I hope
we never leave it.



The Sneetches

Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches
Had bellies with stars.
The Plain-Belly Sneetches
Had none upon thars.  

Those stars weren't so big. They were really so small.
You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all. 

But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches
Would brag, "We're the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches."
With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort
"We'll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!"
And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,
They'd hike right on past them without even talking.  

When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,
Could a Plain-Belly get in the game...? Not at all.
You only could play if your bellies had stars
And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars. 

When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts
Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,
They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.
They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.
They kept them away. Never let them come near.
And that's how they treated them year after year. 

Then ONE day, seems... while the Plain-Belly Sneetches
Were moping and doping alone on the beaches,
Just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars...
A stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars! 

"My friends," he announced in a voice clear and keen,
"My name is Sylvester McMonkey McBean.
And I've heard of your troubles. I've heard you're unhappy.
But I can fix that. I'm the Fix-it-Up Chappie.
I've come here to help you. I have what you need.
And my prices are low. And I work at great speed.
And my work is one hundred per cent guaranteed!"

Then, quickly Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Put together a very peculiar machine.
And he said, "You want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch...?
My friends, you can have them for three dollars each!"

"Just pay me your money and hop right aboard!"
So they clambered inside. Then the big machine roared
And it klonked. And it bonked. And it jerked. And it berked
And it bopped them about. But the thing really worked!
When the Plain-Belly Sneetches popped out, they had stars!
They actually did. They had stars upon thars! 

Then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start,
"We're exactly like you! You can't tell us apart.
We're all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!
And now we can go to your frankfurter parties." 

"Good grief!" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.
"We're still the best Sneetches and they are the worst.
But, now, how in the world will we know," they all frowned,
"If which kind is what, or the other way round?" 

Then came  McBean with a very sly wink.
And he said, "Things are not quite as bad as you think.
So you don't know who's who. That is perfectly true.
But come with me, friends. Do you know what I'll do?
I'll make you, again, the best Sneetches on beaches
And all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches." 

"Belly stars are no longer in style," said McBean.
"What you need is a trip through my Star-Off Machine.
This wondrous contraption will take off your stars
So you won't look like Sneetches who have them on thars."
And that handy machine
Working very precisely
Removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely.

Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about
And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,
"We know who is who! Now there isn't a doubt.
The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches without!" 

Then, of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad.
To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.
Then, of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Invited them into his star-off machine. 

Then, of course from THEN on, as you probably guess,
Things really got into a horrible mess.

All the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,
The fix-it-up Chappie kept fixing up Sneetches.
Off again! On Again!
In again! Out again!
Through the machines they raced round and about again,
Changing their stars every minute or two.
They kept paying money. They kept running through
Until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew
Whether this one was that one... or that one was this one
Or which one was what one ... or what one was who. 

Then, when every last cent
Of their money was spent,
The Fix-it-Up Chappie packed up
And he went. 

And he laughed as he drove
In his car up the beach,
"They never will learn.
No. You can't teach a Sneetch!" 

But McBean was quite wrong. I'm quite happy to say
That the Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,
The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches
And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches
That day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars
And whether they had one, or not, upon thars.



I Can Read with my Eyes Shut

I can read in red.
I can read in blue.
I can read in pickle-color too.

I can read in bed.
And in purple.
And in brown.
I can read in a circle and upside-down!

I can read with my left eye.
I can read with my right.
I can read Mississippi with my eyes shut tight!

Mississippi,
Indianapolis,
and
Hallelujah,
too!
I can read them
with my eyes shut!
That is
VERY HARD
to do!

But it's bad
for my hat
and makes
my eyebrows
get red hot.
SO...
reading with
my eyes shut
I don't do an awful lot.

And when I keep them open
I can read with much more speed.
You have to be a speedy reader
'cause there's so, so much to read!

You can read about trees...
and bees...
and knees.
And knees on trees!
And bees on threes!

You can read about anchors.
And all about ants.
You can read
about ankles!
And crocodile pants!

You can read about hoses...
and how to smell roses...
and what
you should do
about owls on noses!

Young cat! If you keep
your eyes open enough,
oh, the stuff you will learn!
The most wonderful stuff!
You'll learn about...
fishbones...
and wishbones.
You'll learn
about trombones,
too.
You'll learn
about Jake
the Pillow Snake
and all about
Foo-Foo the Snoo.

You can learn about ice.
You can learn about mice.
Mice on ice.
And ice on mice.
You can learn about
the price of ice.
Nice ice
for sale.
Ten cents a pail.

You can learn about SAD...
and GLAD...
and MAD!
There are 
so many things
you can learn about.
BUT...
you'll miss
the best things
if you keep
your eyes shut.

The more that you read,
the more things you will know.
The more that you learn,
the more places you'll go.

You might learn
a way to earn
a few dollars.
Or how to make doughnuts...
or kangaroo collars.

You can learn to read music
and play a Hut-Zut
if you keep your eyes open.
But not with them shut.

If you read with your eyes shut
you're likely to find
that the place where you're going
is far, far behind

SO...
that's why I tell you
to keep your eyes wide.
Keep them wide open...
at least on one side.
